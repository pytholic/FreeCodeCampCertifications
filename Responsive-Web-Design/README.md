* `<figure>` wrapper is used with `<img>` to add caption with `<figcaption>`.
* `<img>` does not require a closing tag.
* The `action` attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, `<form action="/submit-url"></form>` tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path `/submit-url`.
